# react-go

This is simple REST/GraphQL API using React on the Frontend
and Go in the Backend.

To sharp my skills I have decided to swap Bootstrap with TailwindCSS
for styling, and rewrite the entire frontend code using TypeScript
instead of JavaScript. I have also decided to replace graphql-go
with the gqlgen for the GraphQL API.

Lets see how things will work out.
